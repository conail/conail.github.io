Libraries are organized so that they can be reused by independent programs.

# Program Lifecycle Phases

## Static

Accessed during the build of a program.

## Dynamic

Bundled independently of the built executable and loaded at runtime.  The linker loads and links dynamic libraries when preparing for execution.  Alternatively, a program may explicitly request that a module be loaded.
