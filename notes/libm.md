Mathematical operations are grouped together in the C standard library and sometimes distributed as libm.

All of the functions use floating point numbers.

Most functions are defined in math.h, or cmath in C++.  Functions that operate on integers, including abs, labs, div and ldiv, are defined in stdlib.h, or cstdlib in C++.

Functions that deal with angles use radians.
