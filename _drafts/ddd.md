Informal object interaction diagram

- Binding the model and implementation
- Cultivate a concrete language based on the model
- Developing a knowledge-rich model with behavior and enforced rules
- Curating the model / Iteration
- Experimention
- Collaboration
- Abstract principles, capture meaning

Close the feedback loop with technical artifacts

Projects face risk when their language is fractured.

Terminology of daily discussions is disconnected from terminology embedded in the code.

Model-based language should be used to describe system artifacts, tasks and functionality.

Enforce ubiquity of this language.  Grow it over time to capture intricacies.

Prefer concision.

If domain experts don't understand the model, it's wrong.
