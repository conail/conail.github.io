# Motivation

For an immigration process, I had to make an inventory of everything I was taking with me.  This list might be useful starting point if you're moving.

# Electronics

I don't use a standing desk exactly, but have a 24 inch monitor mounted slightly below eye height.  I tilt it upwards 15-20 degrees to work, I took the guidelines from here: Ergonomics.  It's comfortable, but I'd prefer a lower profile mount.

I added a set of shelves around it that double as storage and a desk to set a laptop on.  The top of it is 4-5cm below elbow height.  The shelves are metallic/paramagnetic, which is nice because the closure of the laptop attaches immovably.

## Computer

### Current: ASUS Chromebook Flip C100PA

This is a great device.  It's a convertible tablet, though I rarely use it that way.

#### Advantages

- Solid construction.
- Extremely portable.
- IPS display.
- Fantastic keyboard.  It's small, but very comfortable.
- ARM architecture.  A battery discharge takes about 10 hours.

#### Disadvantages:

- Low resolution display.  Though at 10 inches, it's fine.
- Proprietary power adapter.
- ARM architecture.  Sometimes prebuilt packages aren't available and compilation can be slow.

### Next: ASUS Chromebook Flip C302

This is a more recent model with a larger screen, x86 CPU and USB C charger.

## External HDD

## Monitor

### Current: AOC 24 inch IPS with Speakers

This is a typical mid-range screen, but I liked it so much that whenever I was leaving Boston, I made an extremely half-hearted attempt to sell it and ended up taking it with me in a suitcase.

#### Wall Mount

I've got it mounted on a wall and it looks pretty, but I can't adjust it very much.  I don't think I'd mount it next time if I had more space.

## E-Reader

I use an e-reader a ton, much more than a phone. I love that it only does one thing, although I miss the free 3G and MP3 from the first generation.

### Current: Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 2

I bought a Kindle because there weren't many options.  I hate the restrictive ecosystem and hassle of formatting books for it.  PDF reading leaves much to be desired.

### Next:

Micro USB cable

### Current: Yota Yotaphone 2

It's a small phone with a smaller e-ink screen on the back.  Gimmicky, but occasionally useful.
