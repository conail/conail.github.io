# About this Site

I make a lot of notes.  This site stores them with minimal formatting and generate usable interfaces for display.

The pages below helped me find better ways to organize content.

- [Jekyll Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/)
- [How We build CMS Free Websites](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/), Developement Seed.
- [Overhaul of Page Generation](http://www.rioki.org/2014/12/02/overhaul-of-page-generation.html), rioki.

# After Jekyll

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a great, easy way to preprocess markup files for the web.  That it's built with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) makes it stupidly easy to host a site.

In Jekyll, it would be preferable to have content stored in a directory that is not the project root.  By default, Jekyll finds 'static' content, that is files for which a publication date is not relevant, in the root folder.  It looks for HTML and Markdown files in the root that have a [front matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) YAML block.
